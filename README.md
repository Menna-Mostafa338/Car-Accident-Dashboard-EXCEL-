# Car Accident Dashboard 🚗💥

## Project Overview 🚀

The **Car Accident Dashboard** is a comprehensive data analysis project aimed at uncovering trends and patterns related to car accidents. As a **Data Analyst**, I analyzed a large dataset of car accidents to understand the factors contributing to accident severity, vehicle types involved, weather conditions, and more. The dashboard, built using **Microsoft Excel**, allows for visual exploration of the data, providing insights into accident frequency, severity, and key contributing factors.

## Objective 🎯
The primary objective of this project was to analyze a dataset on car accidents to identify trends and factors influencing the severity of accidents. The goal was to uncover patterns related to:

- Accident severity
- Contributing factors (e.g., weather, road conditions)
- Frequency of accidents across different time periods and locations

## Dataset 📊
The dataset used in this project contains several key columns, including:
- **Accident_Index**: Unique identifier for each accident
- **Accident Date**: Date of the accident
- **Month**: Month of the accident
- **Year**: Year of the accident
- **Day_of_Week**: Day of the week the accident occurred
- **Junction_Control**: Information about the junction control
- **Accident_Severity**: Severity of the accident (e.g., slight, serious, fatal)
- **Latitude**: Latitude of the accident location
- **Longitude**: Longitude of the accident location
- **Number_of_Casualties**: Number of casualties involved in the accident
- **Number_of_Vehicles**: Number of vehicles involved
- **Road_Surface_Conditions**: Road surface conditions during the accident
- **Weather_Conditions**: Weather conditions at the time of the accident
- **Vehicle_Type**: Type of vehicle involved
- and more...

## Process 🔄
1. **Data Cleaning** 🧹: Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.
   - Removed duplicates
   - Handled missing values
   - Corrected inconsistent formatting
   
2. **Data Visualization** 📈: 
   - Used **Microsoft Excel** to create various charts and graphs to visualize the data.
   - Developed pivot tables, bar charts, and heat maps to show trends such as accident frequency by time, severity distribution, and correlations between weather conditions and accident severity.

## Key Insights:
- Identified patterns in accident severity based on time of day, weather conditions, and road surface conditions.
- Analyzed the correlation between the number of vehicles involved and accident severity.
- Visualized hotspots of accidents using geographical data (latitude and longitude).

## Skills & Deliverables 🛠️:
- **Microsoft Excel** for data analysis, cleaning, and visualization
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensured the accuracy and consistency of the dataset
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive charts, graphs, and pivot tables to present insights from the dataset

## Technologies Used:
- **Microsoft Excel** for data manipulation and visualization 🖥️

## How to Use:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the Excel file to explore the car accident dashboard and its visualizations.
3. Interact with the Excel sheets to filter data and examine accident trends.

## About the Project
This project is ideal for anyone interested in exploring traffic data, accident analysis, or data visualization using **Excel**. It offers valuable insights into the causes and severity of car accidents, helping stakeholders, such as city planners and safety analysts, make informed decisions.
